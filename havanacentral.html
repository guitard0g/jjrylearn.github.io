                            Nevertheless, the Cuban food is good enough and not
                            as overpriced as usual tourist traps in the area,
                            making the place a hit for locals and tourists
                            alike. It’s the music, though, that makes coming
                            down to Havana Central worth it. One of the best
                            musical venues to spend a night at in New York.</i

                    <p>
                        As locals, my friends and I usually don’t go anywhere
                        near Times Square if we want to have a fun night out -
                        the area is full of overly crowded, overpriced mediocre
                        restaurants teeming with tourists who don’t want the
                        authentic New York experience. I’m happy to say that
                        after being persuaded to come to Havana Central by
                        visiting friends, this place beats any other Times
                        Square restaurant. First, the restaurant is two floors
                        with generously tall ceilings and a good amount away
                        from the main Times Square, so it wasn’t as
                        claustrophobic as some other spaces nearby. However, it
                        is still in the area, and we did have to wait a sizable
                        amount of time (no reservations made), and when we were
                        inside, we were shoved into a tiny, cheaply-made table
                        wedged uncomfortably close to another party. I didn’t
                        love the seating arrangement and all the waiters seemed
                        so snappy and too busy to actually care about a small
                        party such as ourselves, dampening our experience a
                        little.

                    <p>
                        Despite that, the food and drinks were excellent and
                        more reasonably priced than I expected. Once we could
                        finally get a waiter to pay attention to us, the table
                        shared amazing mojitos, and the paella and pollo asado
                        were perfectly spiced and cooked. All the flavors seemed
                        very authentically Cuban, a rarity in Midtown, and
                        everyone was happy with the generous serving sizes.

                    <p>
                        The food alone was great, but what really made Havana
                        Central more worthwhile than other Times Square
                        restaurants was the live music. The atmosphere was made
                        so lively by the colorful lights and the sheer happiness
                        of the band - you could tell they loved the music they
                        were playing and were having fun with it. There were
                        drums, keyboard, a wonderful lead vocalist with
                        incredible skill, clave, electric guitar, and more
                        instruments I couldn’t recognize (we were pretty far
                        away). The music was mostly salsa with upbeat melodies
                        and loud rhythms - it was dancing music, but there was
                        no room for anyone to dance, though I did see many happy
                        patrons swaying and nodding to the beat, and a couple
                        dancers near the front entrance. What made the
                        experience great was the atmosphere the band provided -
                        the vocalist and musicians would come down and talk to
                        some folks, and they were always laughing and joking,
                        giving the place a friendly, local vibe. We were quite
                        far, so the music was perfectly loud, but I imagine
                        those sitting right in front of the band felt a little
                        deaf after a while. The food was quite good, but the
                        band transformed the place into an authentic experience
                        so enthralling you’ll forget you’re in Times Square.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the place is a nice change of scenery
                        compared to the usual busy American restaurants around
                        Times Square. Beware of long wait times and busy
                        waiters, but altogether worth it if not just for the
                        cheerful band and cheap mojitos.
