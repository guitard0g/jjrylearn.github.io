                            When I first entered Cuba on a busy Saturday
                            evening, I was immediately greeted by the sounds of
                            a live salsa music performance, the smell of rich
                            Cuban cuisine, and the sight of a clearly
                            experienced bartender working to rapidly produce
                            pitchers of mojitos and Sangria.
                        </i>

                    <p>
                        Located on Thompson street in Greenwich Village and
                        originally opened in 2004, Cuba is dedicated to
                        providing its customers with a high-quality, authentic
                        Cuban dining experience. They offer an extensive menu of
                        Cuban, Latin, and Spanish dishes in addition to a wide
                        selection of cocktails. The restaurant hosts live Salsa
                        music performances every Friday and Saturday night, as
                        well as complementary hand rolled cigars prepared by
                        Jose Martinez on Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

                    <p>
                        During my visit to Cuba, because the open area at the
                        front of the restaurant was completely full, the waiter
                        guided us to the back of the restaurant, led us down a
                        set of stairs into the basement, and seated us in a
                        small, dimly lit room with its own separate bar. The
                        hidden-away area felt sort of like a speakeasy, and
                        provided a nice, quiet dining experience away from the
                        restaurant’s very packed main seating area.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For appetizers, we ordered the Calamares con Tamarindo,
                        the Papas Rellenas, and the Chorizo. The calamari dish
                        was drizzled with a tamarind vinaigrette and had sweet
                        plantains mixed in. I thought that the tamarind
                        vinaigrette added a nice sweetness to the dish, and the
                        plantains provided a nice soft, chewy texture that
                        provided a perfect contrast to the crispy calamari. The
                        papas rellenas was a relatively small dish in comparison
                        to the calamari, but I liked the potatoes’ crispy
                        outside and soft, gooey inside. The servers forget about
                        our chorizo order so it ended up arriving after we had
                        already finished out main course, however, its rich,
                        heavy flavor was a good strong note to end our dinner
                        with.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For drinks, we ended up ordering a pitcher of their
                        Passion Fruit Mojito. Because we were seated so closely
                        to the bar, I was able to watch as the bartender muddled
                        a delicious medley of mint, limes, lemons, oranges,
                        cherries, and many other fruits with Bacardi rum,
                        seltzer, lime juice, and simple syrup to create our
                        deliciously sweet pitcher. The pitcher was able to fill
                        up about 6 large wine glasses, which makes it a steal
                        for only $50.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Passion fruit mojito In terms of the music, the band
                        consisted of 3 members who played the keyboard, conga
                        drums, and bass guitar. While it was a relatively small
                        band and they were stuffed in a tight corner of the
                        restaurant in the main seating area, they had a strong,
                        energetic sound that conveyed years of performing
                        experience. While they didn’t provide an official
                        setlist, I was able to recognize their performance of
                        the song “Guantanamera,” a famous guajira from the 1930s
                        that combines a medium-tempo son rhythm with a guitar
                        backing. The band was definitely more of a background
                        performance for diners to listen to while enjoying their
                        food, and because the restaurant was so cramped with
                        seating options, there was no space for people to dance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, I had a very positive dining experience at
                        Cuba. The food was superb, the music was fantastic, the
                        atmosphere felt authentic, and the drinks were to die
                        for. If I had to raise one criticism, the restaurant’s
                        staff were a bit rude and failed to completely write
                        down our initial order. Nevertheless, I had a great time
                        at Cuba, and I would rate the restaurant as 9/10.
