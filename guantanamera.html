                            Upon entering Guantanamera, I waited for no less
                            than forty-five minutes to get any sort of seating.
                            The venue was cramped and the customers were loud
                            but it was the most worthwhile experience I could
                            have ever imagined. The incredible food and drinks
                            would have been enough for a five-star review on
                            their own. The music, on the other hand, left me
                            wondering why I hadn’t sought out vibrant, live
                            performances to accompany my meals before.
                        </i>

                    <p>
                        First, I rarely go to a restaurant where the band is the
                        main focus of the night, but Guantanamera made sure the
                        band delivered. We had looked up the restaurant before
                        going and knew that Guantanamera has live music every
                        night starting at 9:00pm, but it was far louder and more
                        exciting than we could have imagined. Customers from all
                        over gather in this cramped venue night after night to
                        experience top quality food and drink accompanied by
                        energetic live Cuban music. Its location at 56th st and
                        8th Ave makes it a prime spot for anybody passing
                        through midtown looking for an authentic experience,
                        making the spot almost claustrophobic, but friendly and
                        clearly full of regulars. The band playing the night
                        that I went was called Javier Porta y su Ache, a group
                        led by a man who spent his early years studying at a
                        premier music university in Cuba named Javier Porta.

                        There was a slight wait time (for such a prime spot and
                        time, this was totally expected), but soon enough we
                        were seated luckily right in front of the main stage. We
                        got there just in time to hear the band put a Cuban
                        twist on the happy birthday song for some lucky folks,
                        and instantly, the atmosphere was electric and
                        energizing, and everyone was laughing and having a great
                        time. Over the course of the night, we saw an
                        arrangement of bass guitar, keyboard, conga drums,
                        cowbell, and flute by the band, and Javier’s vocals were
                        accompanied by the other musicians’ backup vocals. It
                        was only four men on the stage, but their energetic,
                        rich, and almost non-stop beats kept the energy up all
                        night. The music was mainly some sort of mixture of
                        salsa and timba music, with a modern twist; sometimes
                        the musicians would ad-lib and perform solos that seemed
                        spontaneous but had the precision and perfection of a
                        well-rehearsed piece. The drummer in particular was
                        wonderfully skilled, playing multiple drums loudly and
                        setting a strong beat throughout each course. All the
                        musicians were experts, showing off their incredible
                        skills with electrifying solos and fast fingers.

                        There was only one tune our table really recognized
                        (“New York New York” by Frank Sinatra), but that didn’t
                        stop us from enjoying the rhythm and watching other
                        folks sing along to some popular Cuban songs. You don’t
                        have to be interested or have experience in salsa or
                        Cuban music to enjoy these catchy, vigorous tunes and
                        the charisma of everyone in the band, that’s for sure.

                    <p>
                        I’ve talked so much about the music because it was truly
                        a life-changing experience. I’ve never been to a
                        restaurant that almost made me forget about eating the
                        food, that’s how good the music was. The food, of
                        course, was amazing nevertheless. We ended up ordering
                        empanadas and tapas as a starter, which was much more
                        filling and large than we expected. Then we shared
                        paella marinera, camarones al ajillo, as well as some
                        giant (delicious) pitchers of sangria and guava mojito,
                        which we thoroughly enjoyed. Everything was incredible,
                        but the guava mojito especially had such strong flavors
                        and citrusy zing that you must try it if you have
                        anything.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m usually never wowed by bands at restaurants playing
                        chill, light, forgettable background music, but
                        Guantanamera’s band opened my mind to what live music
                        can really be like. Guantanamera was like being at a
                        concert with stunning energy from everyone, incredible
                        performances, and amazing food as a bonus. I’ll
                        definitely be becoming a regular here and I’m itching to
                        come back. I can’t reiterate enough: try it for
                        yourself!
